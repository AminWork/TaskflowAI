#### **AssigneeSelector Component**
```typescript
// Features:
- Dropdown with member avatars and role indicators
- Search-like interface for member selection
- Unassigned option
- Role-based visual indicators
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
```

#### **Enhanced TaskForm**
```typescript
// New Fields:
- assignee: string | undefined
- estimatedHours: number | undefined

// Features:
- Integrated AssigneeSelector component
- Time estimation input field
- Board member context awareness
- Form validation for assignments
```

#### **Enhanced TaskCard**
```typescript
// Display Features:

- Improved card layout
- Member role context
```

#### **Enhanced SearchAndFilter**
```typescript
// New Filter:
- assigneeFilter: string
- Member dropdown selection
- Unassigned option
- Combined filter logic
```

### **Data Flow**

```typescript
// Task Assignment Flow
User selects assignee in TaskForm
  → assignee state updated
  → Form submission includes assignee ID
  → API call with assignee_id field
  → Backend validates board membership
  → Task saved with assignment
  → Frontend updates with normalized data
  → Task card shows assignee information

// Assignment Filtering Flow
User selects assignee filter
  → assigneeFilter state updated
  → Task list filtered by assignee
  → Display shows filtered results
  → Clear filters resets all filters
```

### **API Integration**

#### **Task Creation/Update**
```typescript
// Request Body includes:
{
  title: string,
  description: string,
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
  category: string,
  status: 'todo' | 'inprogress' | 'done',
  tags: string[],
  estimated_hours: number | null,
  assignee_id: number | null  // New field
}

// Response includes:
{
  id: number,
  // ... other fields
  assignee_id: number | null,
  estimated_hours: number | null
}
```

#### **Data Normalization**
```typescript
// Backend to Frontend transformation:
assignee_id: number | null → assignee: string | undefined
estimated_hours: number | null → estimatedHours: number | undefined

// Frontend to Backend transformation:
assignee: string | undefined → assignee_id: number | null
estimatedHours: number | undefined → estimated_hours: number | null
```

### **State Management**

#### **Task Assignment State**
- **assignee**: Stored as string (user ID) for consistency with frontend types
- **estimatedHours**: Optional number for time estimation
- **Board context**: Assignee validation against current board members
- **Filter state**: Separate assignee filter state management

#### **Component Props Flow**
```typescript
// Props flowing down the component tree:
App → TaskForm: boardMembers={currentBoard?.members}
App → KanbanColumn: boardMembers={currentBoard?.members}
KanbanColumn → TaskCard: boardMembers={boardMembers}
App → SearchAndFilter: boardMembers={currentBoard?.members}
```
