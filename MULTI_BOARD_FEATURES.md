# Enhanced Multi-Board Management Features

## 🎯 Overview
The TaskFlow AI application now supports comprehensive multi-board management, allowing users to create, manage, and switch between multiple kanban boards seamlessly. Each user can have multiple boards with different team members, roles, and permissions.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Board Dashboard** 
- **Centralized board management** with grid and list view modes
- **Search and filtering** by ownership (owned by me, member of)
- **Quick board creation** and selection
- **Visual board cards** showing member count, role, and last updated
- **Board actions** (edit, delete) with proper permissions

### 2. **Real Task Persistence**
- **Backend API integration** - tasks are now stored in PostgreSQL instead of localStorage
- **Board-specific tasks** - each board maintains its own task collection
- **Real-time synchronization** between frontend and backend
- **Proper task CRUD operations** via REST API

### 3. **Enhanced Navigation**
- **Dashboard view** as the default landing page
- **Board selector** in navigation with current board indication
- **Seamless switching** between boards and views
- **Permission-based navigation** - views disabled if no access

### 4. **Multi-Board Task Management**
- **Isolated task spaces** - tasks belong to specific boards
- **Proper task loading** when switching between boards
- **Task operations** (create, edit, delete, move) connected to backend APIs
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket integration

### 5. **Board Creation & Editing**
- **Enhanced board form** supporting both creation and editing
- **Validation and error handling**
- **Automatic board selection** after creation
- **Smooth UI transitions** between dashboard and board views

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

#### New Components
- **`BoardDashboard`** - Central board management interface
- **`useTasks`** hook - Backend-integrated task management
- **Enhanced `BoardForm`** - Create/edit board functionality
- **Updated `Navigation`** - Added dashboard view

#### Data Flow
```typescript
User Login → Fetch Boards → Dashboard View → Select Board → Load Tasks → Manage Tasks
```

#### Task Data Flow
```typescript
// Old: localStorage only
localStorage: kanban-tasks-${boardId}

// New: Backend API integration
API: /api/boards/${boardId}/tasks
   ↓
Normalization: snake_case → camelCase
   ↓
React State: Real-time updates
```

### Backend Integration

#### Task API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/boards/:id/tasks` - Fetch board tasks
- `POST /api/boards/:id/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update existing task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/move` - Move task between columns

#### Data Normalization
```typescript
// Backend Response (snake_case)
{
  id: 1,
  created_at: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  estimated_hours: 5
}

// Frontend Format (camelCase)
{
  id: "1",
  createdAt: new Date("2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  estimatedHours: 5
}
```

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

### 1. **Dashboard Experience**
1. User logs in → automatically lands on Dashboard
2. See all boards in grid/list view with search/filter
3. Quick access to create new board or select existing
4. Visual indicators for role and permissions

### 2. **Board Selection**
1. Click board from dashboard → auto-navigate to Kanban view
2. Use navigation board selector for quick switching
3. Board-specific tasks load automatically
4. Persistent board state across sessions

### 3. **Task Management**
1. All task operations (CRUD) sync with backend
2. Real-time updates via WebSocket
3. Drag-and-drop with backend persistence
4. Permission-based task operations

### 4. **Board Management**
1. Create boards with title/description
2. Edit existing boards (with permissions)
3. Delete boards (owner only)
4. Invite team members with roles

## 🔐 Permission System

### Board-Level Permissions
- **Owner**: Full control (create, edit, delete board + all task permissions)
- **Admin**: Board management + all task permissions (cannot delete board)
- **Member**: Task management (create, edit, delete, move tasks)
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### UI Permission Integration
- Dashboard actions (edit/delete) based on permissions
- Task operations disabled without proper permissions
- Navigation views disabled without board access
- Clear permission feedback to users

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Dashboard Views
- **Grid View**: Card-based layout for visual browsing
- **List View**: Compact table-like layout for efficiency
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Search & Filter**: Powerful board discovery tools

### Navigation Enhancement
- **Board Selector**: Dropdown with current board indication
- **View Tabs**: Dashboard, Kanban, Analytics, Members
- **Permission-aware**: Disabled states for unauthorized views

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Data Loading
- **Lazy loading**: Tasks loaded only when board selected
- **Efficient caching**: Board list cached until user/token changes
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with backend
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for network issues

### State Management
- **Isolated state**: Each board maintains separate task state
- **Memory efficient**: Clear unused task data when switching boards
- **Real-time sync**: WebSocket updates keep data fresh

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Multi-Board Workflow
1. ✅ Create multiple boards as different users
2. ✅ Switch between boards and verify task isolation
3. ✅ Invite users to boards and test permission levels
4. ✅ Create/edit/delete tasks on different boards
5. ✅ Test board creation, editing, and deletion
6. ✅ Verify dashboard search and filtering

### Permission Testing
1. ✅ Test board actions based on user roles
2. ✅ Verify task operations respect permissions
3. ✅ Check navigation access control
4. ✅ Test invitation workflow

### Data Persistence
1. ✅ Logout/login maintains board state
2. ✅ Board switching preserves task data
3. ✅ Real-time updates across browser tabs
4. ✅ Backend API integration working
